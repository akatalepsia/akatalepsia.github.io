title: Our Week in Puerto Rico

Intersession at Princeton: a curious stretch of time bridging the end of fall finals and the start of the spring semester. For many students, this break is a welcome period of stillness, when the pulsating frenzy that is the college experience slows to a pleasant lull. We chose to spend our week off in Puerto Rico, just a quick flight away from campus.

After settling into our Airbnb in San Juan, we stopped for a bite to eat at [Tropical Taste](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tropical-taste-restaurant-san-juan). I ordered mofongo, a popular Puerto Rican dish made of mashed fried plantains.

Just a few steps away from the restaurant is El Parque de Las Palomas, home to a large flock of pigeons and sweeping panoramic views. Benches line the walkway --- a good place to soak up some sun and digest after a meal.

The colors found throughout the neighboring streets were incredibly vivid.

We then checked out Paseo de La Princesa, which was bustling with street vendors selling snacks, trinkets, art, and the like. We followed the path skirting the city wall, stopped at Raices Fountain, and curved our way around the island to La Puerta de San Juan --- the gate to the city. Of course, we had Pokémon Go out to check which Pokémon the island had to offer...

We reentered the city through the gate and walked to [Punto de Vista](https://www.yelp.com/biz/punto-de-vista-san-juan-5), a restaurant with a dramatic rooftop view, to meet up with some friends for dinner. Through a combination of planning and luck, we all decided to visit the same destination for break! And we weren't the only ones at this fairly small restaurant; we ran into another handful of classmates --- also seniors and probably also very happy to get away from the cold winter of the East Coast. I had my first (virgin) piña colada, an experience that left me ordering piña coladas as often as I could for the rest of the trip.

The next morning, we boarded a ferry from the Fajardo terminal to the smaller island of Vieques, an hour and a half away. Vieques has a diverse array of beaches --- we stopped by Black Sand, Sun Bay, and Media Luna.

To get to the Black Sand beach, we took a 15 minute hike from our dropoff point. On the way back, we spotted this guy perching. He was kind enough to stay put through a round of photographs!

That evening, we went on a guided bioluminescence bay tour. I highly recommend the experience, and our friends also had a great time! The kayaks were completely transparent, allowing us to gape at the dazzling streaks of light beneath us. The tour guide also pointed out each constellation visible in the night sky, which we could see fairly well, considering the light pollution coming from the neighboring main island. After the tour, we headed to our place in Vieques for the night.

Who needs alarm clocks when your neighborhood is full of roosters? (Actually, not just this neighborhood and not just roosters --- wild horses roam around the entire island.) One ferry ride later, and we were back on the main island by lunch. (Pro tip: some seating on the ferry is outdoors. Apply sunscreen, and enjoy the ocean breeze!)

We rented a car, met up with our other friends, and headed to the famed El Yunque rainforest --- the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System.

Yocahu Tower offers a stunning vantage point. We also hiked the Big Tree Trail to get to Mina Falls, where the waters are calm enough to stand in --- very refreshing after a trek.

Our Airbnb was in Condado, very conveniently located near good eats, shops, and the beach. The next morning, we enjoyed breakfast at [Bajuice](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bajuice-san-juan-3) --- probably our favorite of Puerto Rico evidenced by us visiting three times! Their fresh drinks captured my fantasy of what island nectar must taste like.

After trying out paddle boating in Condado Lagoon, we stopped for a late lunch at [Ola Ocean Front Bistro](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ola-ocean-front-bistro-san-juan).

Next up was a visit to Castillo San Felipe del Morro (or simply "El Morro"), a favorite of tourists and a beautiful place to catch the sunset as it is located at the westernmost point of San Juan. We rounded out the day with dinner at [Cocina Abierta](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cocina-abierta-san-juan).

Our last couple days were relaxed --- filled with strolls along the beach and around Condado, food, and sun. Our final dinner in Puerto Rico was at [Perla](https://www.yelp.com/biz/perla-san-juan), probably the most beautiful building housing a restaurant that I’ve seen. Everything about the place was stunning, from the aqua-tinged shell walls to our seats overlooking a large stretch of ocean and beach.

We spent our final morning relaxing at Condado, before catching our flight back. And that wraps up our trip --- off to finish the last semester at Princeton!
