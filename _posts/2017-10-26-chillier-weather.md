Summer has come to an end, but I do love what fall has to offer. Something in the air never fails to induce nostalgia every time this year --- perhaps since September has marked so many new beginnings. I used to anticipate seeing the first frost emerge on our lawn where I grew up --- now that I've moved to NYC, I'll be on the lookout for new markers.

#### Brunch on Amsterdam Ave, near Columbia University

I do love how different each neighborhood in NYC feels --- [Flat Top](https://www.yelp.com/biz/flat-top-new-york) felt like an oasis from where I usually spend my time.
